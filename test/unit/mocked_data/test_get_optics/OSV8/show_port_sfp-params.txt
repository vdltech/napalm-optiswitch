 SFP ports internal EEPROM data
================================
 Port  1: Failed to get EEPROM Data, This is not an SFP type port or the SFP is not connected.
 Port  2: Failed to get EEPROM Data, This is not an SFP type port or the SFP is not connected.
 Port  3: Failed to get EEPROM Data, SFP is not inserted
 Port  4: Failed to get EEPROM Data, SFP is not inserted
